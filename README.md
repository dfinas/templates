# templates
templates allow to generate full resolved configuration files which can be used by external tools and applications.

For each folder, you will find:
- a "<type>.js" file which is a SWEAGLE template parser to generate <type> of files
- a "<type>.model.json" file which is a SWEAGLE model template that matches the templates in term of organisation of your data. You can also import it in SWEAGLE in order to test your template.
